# RISCV-DV

Test generation using riscv-dv
```
run --target rv32i --test riscv_arithmetic_basic_test --testlist testlist.yaml --simulator pyflow
```


to find coverage 
cov --dir out/spike_sim/ --simulator=pyflow --enable_visualization


then pyguis report out/

# Challenge
The challenge is to fix the tool problem in generating coverage and make rv32i ISA coverage 100%
